 This was the final project to complete my university studies. It's a desktop application where you can add all the fees that a student can have at college and outside of it. 
This project is built in JavaFX and H2 for the database.
The main functionalities are:
- add semesters, where can add subjects and make two actions: note a paid tax or make a reminder to pay a tax
- note all the books loaned from library and make a reminder to return books
- note all the costs for rent, food, transport, leisure
- generate graphic to view all the money spent in one day, one month, one year or a period of time
